        <p>
          As your next State Land Commissioner, I will ensure New Mexico's lands are managed with integrity, transparency, and a commitment to the people who depend on them. From strengthening the oil and gas sector to preserving our agricultural roots and mitigating the devastating impacts of wildfires, I will work to put our land back to work for all New Mexicans.
